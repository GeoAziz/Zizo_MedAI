# Zizo_MediAI Doctor Module Progress Report

This document outlines the current state of the Doctor module, what has been completed, and what advanced features are planned for a future, full-production implementation.

---
## âœ… Completed Features (Core Functionality)
---

The foundation of the Doctor module is complete, providing a comprehensive and interactive experience that showcases all intended features.

1.  **Full Doctor Navigation:**
    -   The Doctor Dashboard (`/doctor/dashboard`) is complete and acts as a functional navigation hub.
    -   All dashboard cards and sidebar links correctly navigate to their respective detailed pages.

2.  **Live Database Integration (Core Features):**
    -   **Dashboard Patient List:** The main dashboard successfully **reads** the real list of patients from the Firestore `users` collection.
    -   **E-Prescription Module:** This feature is **100% functional**. The form reads the patient list from Firestore and **writes** new prescription documents to the correct patient's sub-collection via a secure server action.

3.  **Live AI Integration (Demonstration):**
    -   **Live Consults:** The "Suggest Diagnosis" feature is fully connected to the `suggestDiagnosis` Genkit flow and displays real AI-generated results.
    -   **Digital Charting:** The "Analyze with AI" feature is fully connected to the `analyzeMedicalImage` Genkit flow and displays a real, structured analysis of the selected image.

4.  **Functional Frontend Mockups:**
    -   The following pages have been fully built from a frontend perspective. They are interactive and populated with realistic mock data to demonstrate their intended purpose completely:
        -   `/doctor/patient-list` (with sorting and filtering)
        -   `/doctor/live-consults` (the video and chat UI)
        -   `/doctor/charts` (the image and annotation UI)
        -   `/doctor/surgery-schedule` (with daily view and editing)

## ðŸš€ Advanced Features (Future Implementation)
---

These are the next steps to transition the module from a high-fidelity prototype to a full-production system.

1.  **Full Live Data Integration for Mockups:**
    -   **Patient List:** Connect the detailed patient list to Firestore, including their mock status, last visit, and other details.
    -   **Charts & Annotations:** Connect the charting system to a database (like Firestore) to save and retrieve real patient chart notes and image annotations.
    -   **Surgery Schedule:** Connect the schedule to a "surgeries" collection in the database.

2.  **Real-Time Communication:**
    -   **Live Consults:** Replace the placeholder video image with a real WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) implementation to enable live video and audio streaming between doctor and patient.

3.  **Refine AI Tools:**
    -   **Automated Charting:** Implement an AI flow that listens to the consultation audio and automatically generates a SOAP note or summary.
    -   **AI Pre-Op Planner:** For the Surgery Schedule, develop the AI models needed to analyze patient data and suggest optimal surgical plans.

4.  **Integration with External Systems:**
    -   **Pharmacy Integration:** Connect the E-Prescribe module to a real pharmacy network API for direct transmission.
    -   **EHR/EMR Integration:** Develop services to sync patient data with existing Electronic Health Record systems used by the hospital.
