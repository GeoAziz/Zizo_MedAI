# Zizo_MediAI Admin Module Progress Report

This document outlines the current state of the Admin module, what has been completed, and what advanced features are planned for a future, full-production implementation.

---
## âœ… Completed Features (Core Functionality)
---

The foundation of the Admin module is complete. It is visually representative of the final product and contains the most critical feature for customer self-service.

1.  **Full Admin Navigation:**
    -   The main Admin Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`) is complete and acts as a functional navigation hub.
    -   All dashboard cards correctly link to their respective detailed pages.

2.  **User Management (100% Functional):**
    -   The User Management page (`/admin/user-management`) is fully implemented and connected to the live Firebase backend.
    -   **Reads:** Displays a real-time list of all users from the Firestore `users` collection.
    -   **Writes:** The "Add New User" dialog successfully creates new users in both Firebase Authentication and Firestore via a secure server action. This is the cornerstone of the hospital admin's toolkit.

3.  **Functional Frontend Mockups:**
    -   The following pages have been fully built from a frontend perspective. They are interactive and populated with realistic mock data to demonstrate their intended purpose completely:
        -   `/admin/system-map`
        -   `/admin/resource-dispatch`
        -   `/admin/outbreak-monitor`
        -   `/admin/ai-logs`

## ðŸš€ Advanced Features (Future Implementation)
---

These are the next steps to transition the module from a high-fidelity prototype to a full-production system.

1.  **Live Data Integration for Dashboard & Mockups:**
    -   **System Status:** Connect the dashboard card to a live backend service to report real metrics (e.g., user count from Firestore, API latency from a monitoring tool).
    -   **System Map:** Replace the placeholder image with a real mapping library (e.g., Google Maps API) and pull facility statuses from the database.
    -   **Resource Dispatch:** Connect the resource and incident lists to a real-time database collection that can be updated by other parts of the system.
    -   **AI Logs:** Integrate with a production-ready logging service (like Google Cloud Logging) to stream real logs from Genkit flow executions.

2.  **Backend AI Model Implementation:**
    -   **Outbreak Monitor:** Develop and train the machine learning models required to analyze anonymized data and generate real outbreak predictions. This is a major data science initiative.

3.  **Refine Admin Tools:**
    -   **User Management:** Add "Edit User" and "Suspend User" functionality.
    -   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement more granular permissions. For example, create a "Front Desk" role that can create patients but not doctors.
    -   **Tenant Management:** For a true multi-tenant SaaS, create a top-level "Zizo_MediAI Super Admin" dashboard to manage the hospital customers themselves.

4.  **Reporting & Analytics:**
    -   Build a new "Reports" section where admins can generate reports on user activity, facility usage, AI model accuracy, and other key performance indicators.
