# Zizo_MediAI Patient Module Progress Report

This document outlines the current state of the Patient module, what has been completed, and what advanced features are planned for a future, full-production implementation.

---
## âœ… Completed Features (Core Functionality)
---

The foundation of the Patient module is complete and represents a full-featured, high-fidelity prototype.

1.  **Full Patient Navigation:**
    -   The Patient Dashboard (`/patient/dashboard`) is complete and acts as a functional navigation hub to all other patient-facing sections.
    -   The main application header and sidebar are fully functional for patient users.

2.  **Live Database Integration (Core Features):**
    -   **Dashboard:** The dashboard successfully **reads** live appointment and prescription data from Firestore.
    -   **Appointments & Prescriptions Pages:** These pages **read** the complete list of records from their respective sub-collections in Firestore.
    -   **Booking Module:** The appointment booking form is **100% functional** and **writes** new appointment requests to the user's record in Firestore via a secure server action.

3.  **Live AI Integration (Multi-Flow):**
    -   **AI Consultation:** This feature is fully connected to the backend. It successfully calls the `suggestDiagnosis` Genkit flow to get text analysis and then calls the `generateAudio` Genkit flow to create a playable audio summary of the results.

4.  **Polished User Experience:**
    -   **Loading Skeletons:** The patient dashboard now features a loading skeleton, providing a smooth experience while data is being fetched.
    -   **Emergency SOS Button:** A global SOS button is present in the header, linking to the emergency module.

5.  **Functional Frontend Mockups:**
    -   The following pages have been fully built from a frontend perspective. They are interactive and populated with realistic mock data to demonstrate their intended purpose completely:
        -   `/patient/lab-results`
        -   `/patient/records`
        -   `/patient/virtual-body-viewer`
        -   The entire `/facilities` module (list, details).
        -   The entire `/emergency` module (tracking, profile, triage).

## ðŸš€ Advanced Features (Future Implementation)
---

These are the next steps to transition the module from a prototype to a full-production system.

1.  **Live Data for Mockups:**
    -   **Vitals:** Integrate with a real HealthKit/Google Fit API or a database of wearable data to display live vitals on the dashboard.
    -   **Lab Results & Records:** Connect these pages to a secure backend service or specialized database (like a FHIR server) to pull real patient data.

2.  **Real-Time Communication & Tracking:**
    -   **Emergency Tracking:** Replace the placeholder map with a real-time mapping library (e.g., Google Maps API) to show the live location of a dispatched ambulance.
    -   **Telehealth Integration:** Implement WebRTC for real video calls within the platform, connecting patients and doctors.

3.  **Refine Patient Engagement Tools:**
    -   **Health Missions:** Develop the logic and UI for the gamified health goals feature.
    -   **Notifications:** Implement a push notification system (e.g., via Firebase Cloud Messaging) for appointment reminders and critical alerts.

4.  **Advanced AI Features:**
    -   **Virtual Body Viewer:** Develop the complex 3D rendering and data mapping technology required for the holographic body scan.
    -   **Personalized Insights:** Create AI flows that proactively analyze patient data to provide personalized health tips or warnings on their dashboard.
